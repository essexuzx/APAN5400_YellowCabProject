# APAN5400_YellowCabProject

The Term Project is a group assignment that is based on the content and sequence of weekly lectures, individual assignments, and quizzes. Students will form teams (max. 5 per team) and work with a chosen Big Data set. They will have to formulate a data analytics use case around the dataset and engineer a data processing system using at least 3 technologies studied in the course. An example term project may involve designing an information retrieval system with a front-end API service and back-end SQL and NoSQL data stores.

Details
The Term Project deliverables include: 

1. Data store and ETL process designs, as well as the Python implementation of the end-to-end data management application
2. Live presentation with a demo of an API or an interface for interaction with the application. The presentation must contain:

   Background and definition of the data analytics problem

   Data source specification and procurement details

   Implemented design choices and the rationale for using the selected technologies

   Applicable data quality dimensions, licensing, scalability, and any cost implications

   Conclusion and future recommendations
   
During the last 2 class sessions, each student group will be presenting their slide deck with participation of every group member.
